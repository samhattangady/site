			<p>As that ominous title suggests, I think I am done working on the parabolae
prototype. Overall, the purpose of a prototype like that is to try and
demonstrate the potential that a particular set of ideas can hold, and how they
can be expressed in the form of a game.</p>
<p>In my mind, the idea that I had for <em>parabolae</em> was something to do with space
and geometry. The fact that you can fire a projectile and then recall it creates
a contrast between parabolic curves and straight lines, and I was really
interested in seeing what kind of interesting phenomena something like that
would create.</p>
<p>However, as I delved deeper and deeper into developing the concept, and spending
a lot of time with the level design aspects, I was forced to reconcile with the
fact that, as of today atleast, my skills as a level designer do not allow me to
explore the system that we had created. I found myself relying on the same level
design crutches in making the levels interesting, and in most cases, the levels
were becoming more a case of pedantry than insight.</p>
<p>When levels that seem easy are difficult because they require an arbitrary
number of steps, none of which neccessarily teach you anything new about the
mechanics that you are presenting, that is probably the best sign that you&rsquo;re
following a bad idea, or are unable to find the interesting nuggets due
to a lack of skill or a faulty approach.</p>
<p>Overall, I think that in the whole game, there was only a single interesting
idea what I was able to find:
When we have a valley shape, and we drop a projectile into it, then moving from
side to side and &ldquo;summoning&rdquo; the projectile will cause it to slowly climb up and
out of the valley. This is caused because of the shape of the valley and the
fact that the summoning positions are slightly elevated.</p>

<p>I think that this is a great idea, and is well demonstrated by the level. But
unfortunately, we need a lot more ideas like this in order to actually create an
entire game, and I was unable to find more such ideas, and eventually came to
the conclusion that it is probably better for me to abandon this idea right now.
There may come a point in the future where I return to this, and see if I am
able to actually do justice to exploring the possibilities.</p>
<h3 id="what-comes-next">What Comes Next</h3>
<p>While the realization that I was unable to develop <em>this</em> game was a humbling
moment that brought me back to the ground, eventually I got back up and got
started again. Now I am a couple of weeks into another prototype, quite
different from the previous one.</p>
<p>From a high concept level, it is a <em>pirate navigation</em> game, where you play the
role of a navigator, and your job is to lead pirate ships to port, and merchant
ships into ambush zones, where you can steal all their treasures. You do this by
placing <em>instructions</em> into the sea map, and the ships all have a predictable AI
that allows you to direct them wherever you may want to.</p>

<p>From a genre standpoint it lies somewhere between a puzzlegame and a
<a href="https://www.zachtronics.com/">Zach-like</a>. I&rsquo;m not yet sure whether the levels
will have a single solution, or a larger solution space, and there are also a
lot more things on the game to work out, and work on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
