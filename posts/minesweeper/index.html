<p>Her face was bathed in white light as she leaned closer to the monitor. “If this is a 1, then one of these two must be a mine…” she thought aloud, her fingers touching the screen.</p>
<p>“And if you look at <em>that</em> tile…” he gently prodded.</p>
<p>“<em>This</em> must be the mine!” she shrieked, her face now glowing brighter than the monitor.</p>

<p>She was playing minesweeper. And she was loving it. That’s how it started in my office. With her. And a few others like her, and it slowly spread from there. There was just something about the game that drew us in. It was the thrill of solving the puzzle. Of finding the solution. It was the idealistic notion there was some semblance order in absolute randomness, and we would be able to find it. Or maybe it was just fun to play.</p>
<hr>
<p>Growing up, I really loved our family computer. It really was a thing of play for me. I had a myriad of ways to entertain myself. I could open up MS Paint and create art. These fantastic kaleidoscopic masterpieces that deserved to be hung on the walls of the most prestigious museums and galleries. Or at least I thought they did. Six-year-olds rarely have taste. And if not for paint, all the animated screensavers would take their turns in hypnotising me.</p>
<p>But of course, most of my time on the computer was spent playing games. I raced bikes against violent criminals in <em>Road Rash</em>, and explored great castles in <em>Prince of Persia</em>. I learnt aerial dogfighting in <em>Crimson Skies</em>, and was a space cadet in <em>Pinball</em>. I could do absolutely anything. Though of course, when I say I played these games, that does come with a small caveat.</p>
<p>You see, I was, and still am for that matter, the younger sibling. A lot of my playing mostly involved sitting in the small chair next to my brother and watching him play. And if not that, it was sitting on the floor next to my brother on the small chair, with both of us watching one of my cousins play. Sometimes I was allowed to participate. In <em>Crimson Skies</em>, I was in charge of launching the missiles. I pressed the left control key when explicitly instructed to do so. And I loved it.</p>
<p>When I didn’t have a brother to support/spectate, I couldn’t really play the same games. I lacked the fine motor skills and the finger length to manoeuvre planes or bikes, as well as the judgement skill required to jump over chasms in the castles. So at these times, I generally resorted to some more peaceful games.</p>
<p>Start — Programs — Accessories — Games</p>
<p>That’s where my treasure was. Some games I knew how to play. <em>Solitaire</em>. Some games I still don’t. <em>Freecell</em>. But there was always one that intrigued me the most. <em>Minesweeper</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t really know how to play it. But I loved it. It has that smiling face at the top, and he would change expressions whenever you did things. He would be anxious when you were about to click. He would make a funny face when you burst a mine. Oh, and best of all, when you won the game (or in my case, changes the settings to automatically win the game in one click), he would put on his shades, and look like the coolest son of a gun you’d ever seen.</p>
<p>It was probably a decade before I actually found out about the rules of minesweeper. I had been convinced that it was a game of luck. That day, I went back home, and was captivated by the absolute genius that was minesweeper.</p>
<p>So the design of minesweeper is fairly straightforward. You have a minefield, filled with mines. Your job is to reveal all the safe areas. To reveal any tile, you click on it. If you click on a mine, you lose. If there is no mine under that tile, it will show a number, which tells you how many mines are present in the surrounding eight tiles.</p>
<p>There are some other fancy things that you can do, like right clicking to flag a mine, which allows you to clear the nearby area faster, or right-clicking twice, to put a question mark on a tile. Why anyone would do that is still a mystery to me.</p>
<h3 id="born-out-of-this-simple-design-is-a-fairly-elegant-and-complex-game">Born out of this simple design is a fairly elegant and complex game.</h3>
<p>There are patterns that emerge, and once you spot them, you can clear those areas a lot faster. You discover relationships between different patterns and arrangements and slowly get better at solving the game.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently, I read that Solitaire was introduced to teach early Windows users how to use the mouse, specifically, how to use the drag-and-drop functionality of the mouse, as well as the double-click. Similarly, minesweeper was introduced to teach users about right-clicking. I could not really verify this anywhere, and couldn’t really be bothered to as well. It still is an interesting story, and that is what it shall remain.</p>
<p>So now, as this minesweeper craze takes over my office, I find myself more and more obsessed by this game. As you get better, you almost reach a zen-like meditative state, where your mouse seems to be moving with a mind of its own. Clicking and flagging to clear entire swaths of land of mines, and making them safe again for civilian use.</p>
<p>When starting off, the game feels pretty hard and all the mistakes that you make seem painfully preventable. Once you click on a mine, you can’t feel worse than how stupid you feel. But slowly you get the hang of it, and stop making the obvious mistakes. You gain a real appreciation for efficiency. You try to improve the order that you click tiles in, so that you can clear the field in minimum number of clicks.</p>
<p>However, every so often, you get stuck in a corner, generally after the rest of the board has been cleared, where suddenly all the things that you learnt are no longer useful. All the hints that you are given do not allow you to solve the game. All the techniques and shortcuts that you had developed are moot. At this point, you just have to grit your teeth, cross your fingers, and guess.</p>
<p>See, there is one seemingly odd thing in the design of minesweeper. which I truly believe, is what makes it great. You see, every minefield is randomly generated. While this provides a practically infinite source of different games, it also means that not every minefield can be cleared without at least a bit of luck and guesswork. So you can potentially play a perfect game, and still get stuck in a corner, with no way to complete the game short of dumb luck.</p>
<p>I think this is what really draws me towards this game. There’s something raw about it. It doesn’t try to sugarcoat itself for your consumption.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have always been a big fan of YouTube. I have spent many hours binging through entire channels worth of content. It’s just something about the format that allows raw passion to shine. I am passionate about passion. I have watched videos about dog training, watercolour painting, videogame analysis, physics and book binding. The only thing that they had in common was the passion of the creator.</p>
<p>With passion, comes depth. People that are passionate about their respective subjects, also generally immerse themselves in their depth. And depth is a misleading thing. For an outsider, topics generally may not seem very deep, but once you get into a thing, absolutely anything, you can start seeing how deep it truly goes.</p>
<p>I guess that was my experience with minesweeper as well. As a kid, I thought it was all about luck. Once I found out about the rules, I figured it was a computational puzzle. But once I really got into it, I learnt its intricacies. I learnt to spot the different patterns that mines and numbers create. I learnt how to clear large swathes of the board with the most efficient clicks. I made strategies of how to deal with different spreads. I learnt how to deal with the randomness.</p>
<p>No matter how good you get at the game, you can never tell which board you will get next. All your previous high-scores count for nothing when you are faced with that new minefield. Regardless of how well you play, you might still get stuck in a corner and just have to rely on luck.</p>
<h3 id="at-its-heart-minesweeper-is-just-like-life">At its heart, minesweeper is just like life.</h3>

<p><strong>On a side note&hellip;</strong>: In this process, I accidentally ended up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDKaxTliecA">getting a global high score</a> by <a href="https://github.com/samhattangady/nimbus2018">writing a bot</a> that solves minesweeper.</p>
