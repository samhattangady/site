_Here Be Dragons._

That's what map makers used to mark the unmapped seas. I guess the idea was to scare
off potential explorers from going to these _literal_ uncharted waters.

I don't really know how effective a strategy like that would be. I mean if there was a
chance to actually see dragons, I'm pretty sure that's quite a strong calling for a lot
of folks out there.

Maybe that's why it's _Here be Dragons_ and not _Here be Paperwork_.

Or _Here be another random blogger._
