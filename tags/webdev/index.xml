      <description>The first rule of responsive web design is often shouted off the rooftops.
Design for mobile first. Always mobile first. I know this rule. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it several times. I&amp;rsquo;ve been rudely awoken from my sleep because of all the rooftop screaming. So what do you think I did when I was building my web based crossword app? I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother considering for mobile..
Maybe I am a rebel. Or maybe I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough faith in my ability to actually see a project through, and rather than getting stuck in the quagmire of figuring what exactly it means to design for mobile first, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d rather just dive in, and figure out all those other things along the way.</description>
